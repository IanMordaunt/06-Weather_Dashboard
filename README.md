# Result:
This assigment presented an oportunity to implement all that we learned so far in the bootcamp.

Using dynamic HTML and JavaScript we are able to creat full funtional webpages with stored data and responce.

Taking a step futher the use of JQuery allowed the developer to navigate the DOM and add element from JS.

Fetching/getting data thru API urls then navigating though the parameters to pull select information was truely a learning process.

Finally making sure the UI is styled to please the eye help complement the funtionality.
